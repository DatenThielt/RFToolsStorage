/**
 * When the storage scanner requests the craft of an item this happens through requestCraft. What
 * happens then is described here.
 * <p>
 * First a device that is capable of crafting this item is selected. Which device is chosen depends on a few factors:
 * - The device must have a crafting card that can output this item
 * - Devices that are currently idle are preferred
 * - Optional (maybe?): a device that has a 'cheaper' recipe available is preferred. Question: how to calculate the cost of a recipe? A few factors:
 * - Amount of ingredients
 * - Time to craft
 * <p>
 * A CraftingRequest is created. This crafting request contains the desired itemstack as well as all itemstacks that
 * preceeded this request in a crafting chain. When a craft is requested from the storage scanner this chain will be empty.
 * This chain can be clarified better with an example. Say you have a system containing three recipes: one for a redstone
 * torch, one to make redstone from a block of redstone and one to make a block of redstone from redstone. When the storage
 * scanner requests the craft of a redstone torch it will make a CraftingRequest containing an empty chain and the
 * redstone torch as an ItemStack. This is given to the CraftingSystem. The crafting system assigns the request to a
 * crafting manager. This crafting manager checks what items are available in the storage. The following three
 * options are possible:
 * - All items for the recipe in the request are available in storage. These items are fetched and given to the device that
 * supports this recipe. The crafting starts
 * - Some or all of the items are not available but there are existing recipes in the crafting system to make the
 * ingredients. For every one of these ingredients a new crafting request is made which contains the desired
 * ingredient as well as a reference to the current crafting request (as a chain). In this
 * example that could mean a new request for a piece of redstone with the request for the redstone torch added to the chain.
 * The crafting request is suspended in the crafting system
 * - Some or all of the items are not available and no recipes exist for them. The request fails immediatelly
 * <p>
 * The reason for the chain is to prevent loops (in this case between the redstone -> redstone block and redstone block -> redstone
 * recipes). A request will never be granted if it requests something that is already in the chain of the current request.
 * <p>
 * Whenever a crafting manager finishes with a craft it will send the result(s) back to the storage and a general broadcast
 * is sent to all crafting manager that they should possibly continue with suspended requests (can this be optimized?)
 * <p>
 * Optional? every N ticks the crafting system can try resuming some of the suspended requests in case the user inserted
 * needed items into storage manually.
